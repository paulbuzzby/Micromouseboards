# Micromouseboards
Here are different sets of PCBs for various Micro Mouse applications. This is the start of me using KiCad. I make no promises that any of this works.

Some of these boards (MouseSMDUKMARSAdvancedBoard and MouseMainboardTemplate) started as UKMARS boards that can be found [Here](https://github.com/ukmars/ukmarsbot)

All credit to Peter Harrison for the original design of these boards

Circuit design for the other boards is credited to Duncan Louttit
